# Snake-C++-Console
A small and simple snake game made in C++ and drawn using the console window.

The project was just a small little test as to how I would go about creating a simple game loop and draw it using characters. ASCII art games such as Dwarf Fortress and Minesweep have always interested me and so I undertook this to see how one could be made.

It's not entirely efficient and the draw calls are so high the screen flickers, but it works and turned out far better than I expected.

Code is commented for clarity.
